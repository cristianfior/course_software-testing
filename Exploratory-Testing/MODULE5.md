# MODULE5: TOURS
It's like you're on a trip, and you can choice what you gonna do: visit whatever rocks your boat, create a route and visit the interesting points or hire a guide to tell you. When visiting back the same city, you can choose between visit the same places or new places.
The tests are the same, so you can do it on freestyle, you can test based on scenarios, or do based on feedbacks. And in retrogression tests, you can test the same scenarios but diferently or test new scenarios.
