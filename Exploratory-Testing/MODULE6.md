# MODULE6: Other strategies
### Shoe Test
Take off your shoe and, literally, spank the keyboard with it. Some systems break with random combinations.

### Get one, take one
We compare two instances of an application and see if using one of the instances affects the other in some way. Helps to see the paralelism of the system and how the application will handle with this.

### Bookmark
Save specifics urls of a web application and try to enter directly on it to see how the system works.

### Sabotage
Understand the dependencies of application, remove them and see how the application works.
