    - When?

### Mind map
    - Map the software
        - What will be developed
        - What will be tested
        - Necessities
        - Restrictions

### Functional and non-functional requirements
1. Functional
    1. Business
        - Functional suitability
2. Non-functional
    1. Technical
        - Usability
        - Compatibility
        - Confiability
        - Eficiency
        - Maintainability
        - Portability
        - Security

### User story
- User request
- How user will be going to use it
- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small
- Testable
    - Be objective

### Product Backlog
- All user stories we have

### Sprint
- Work cycle
    - eXtreme Programming, 1week
    - Scrum, 2~4 week
    - Kanban, can or not have sprint

### Sprint Backlog
- All selected user stories we will be doing in this cycle

### Epics
- Some stories that join to make a huge story

### Features
- An intermediate between story and epic

### Risk analysis
- It's a negative event
    - It could happen or not
    - Impact, loss and pain
- Process
    - Identify the risks
    - Risk analysis
        - Probability, high or medium  or low
        - Impact, high or medium  or low
    - Risk priorization
        - Risk = Probability x Impact 
    - Risk treatment strategy
        - Purge or avoid, resolve completely
        - Mitigate or prevent, reduce the change or impact of the risk
        - Accept, passively or actively
        - Transfer, pass the risk to another
    - Monitor risks
        - Period
        - Responsible
        - Reassess

### Risk matrix
| Risk name | Probability | Impact | Risk = Probability x Impact | Strategy | How? | Responsible | Reassess |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | --------------------------- | -------- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
|           |             |        |                             |          |      |             |          |

### Planning Poker
- Team dinamic
- Ease discussion and voting in scopes, deadlines, complexity, risks

### Risks historic
- Helps to make good decisions
- Creates a preservation culture
    - Estimates
    - Risks
    - Decisions, cheaper, faster, better

### Pareto Analysis
- Priorization of the most important
- Based on the restrictions
    - Deadline
    - Budget
    - People
    - Resources

### Impulse prioritization
- Greater to smaller

### Attraction prioritization
- A prioritized item attract smaller items that can be resolved together

### Longtail analysis
- Sampling
- Is based that it has distributed budget in a large variation of products and services
- Combinatory tests helps
    - Pairwise
