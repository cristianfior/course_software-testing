# Module 02: Introduction to Software Testing
### Testing types based on IEC/ISO 25010, SQuaRE (System and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation)
1. Functional suitability: given function works as expected
    - Functional completeness, do what is designed to do
    - Functional fix, verify if the result is the expected
    - Appropriate to functionality, verify if the result is really appropriated
2. Usability
    - Recognizability, ease of user recognition of elements
    - Learnability, ease of user learnability
    - Operability, ease the operation and navigation of the system
    - Protection against user error, standardize the system to avoid user errors
    - User interface aesthetics, a good ui
    - Accessibility, ease of access to everyone
3. Compatibility
    - Coexistence, ease of coexistence with another modules or systems
    - Interoperability, ease of comunication with another modules or systems
4. Confiability
    - Maturity, realize and prevent a failure before it happens
    - Disponibility, remain available to users and systems
    - Tolerance to failure, realize and compensate the failures in real-time
    - Recuperability, recover from failures
5. Eficiency
    - Behavior relationed to Time, performance
    - Resources use, utilization of the resources like RAM, processor, disk
    - Capacity, to attend users and transactions
6. Maintainability
    - Modularity, module-oriented
    - Reusability, ease of reuse
    - Analyzability, easy to analyze
    - Modifiability, easy to modify
    - Testability, easy to test
7. Portability
    - Adaptability, ease of adaptation
    - Instalability, ease of installation and uninstallation
    - Substitutability, ease of replacement
8. Security
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Responsability
    - Authenticity

> Business tests: functional tests

> Technical tests: non-functional tests
