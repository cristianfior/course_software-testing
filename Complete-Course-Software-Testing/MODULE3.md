| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Low execution speed                     | High execution speed                |
| Repetitive and tiring                   | Don't tire                          |
| Don't depend on another technology      | Necessary know some technologies    |
| High cost after every execution         | High cost only in the creation      |
| Limitations when testing big paralelism | Able to test some unusual scenarios |
| More exploratory                        | Do only who was desgined to test    |
