# Module 02: Test Levels: When to test?
### Level 1: Unit Test
Test the smallest part of the system: a class, a method, a function and etc.
- Made in the lowest level of the software;
- Tested by the developer;
- Usually automated with frameworks like: JUnit, PHPUnit...
- Need to be always up-to-date with the current software business rules
- Can be did before the software is ready;

### Level 2: Integration Test
Test a component of the system: a set of classes, method or functions and etc.
- Tested by the developer;
- Usually automated with frameworks like: JUnit, PHPUnit...
- Can be did before the software is ready;

### Level 3: System Test
Test the software as if you are the user with the vision of a tester.
- Planned and executed by tester team;
- Graphic test, made after the software is ready;

### Level 4: Acceptance Test
Teste the software by the point of view of the user.
- Made by a representation of the user (can be another team of the company, like the support-team)
- Graphic test, made after the software is ready;

### Level 5: Alpha Test
Similar to Acceptance Test, but here is for a small group of users who knows of the software development, but not followed it (something between 50 to 100).
- Monkey Test
- Dev-Team give support to questions, bugs and fixes;
- Graphic test, made after the software is ready;

### Level 6: Beta Test
Similar to Alpha Test, but the users are random and the goup of user is bigger (something bigger than 500).
- Graphic test, made after the software is ready;

### Level 7: Regression Test
Retest the system after new changes to confirm if the software is working corretly.
